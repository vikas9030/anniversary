            <h2>Our Beautiful Journey</h2>
            <p>Hemuu</p>
            <p>
                Four months down, and what a journey it's been. We've shared so much laughter, but we’ve also seen each other through some tough fights and real problems. Knowing that we always find our way back to each other, stronger because of it, is what makes our
                connection so incredibly special to me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even through the storms, the love we have shines through brighter than anything else. You are the person I want by my side.
            </p>
            <p>
                As we step into this fifth month, please know this: I cherish every moment, the good and the challenging. You are my half, and I truly want you to be my half forever.
            </p>
            <p>Here's to many more months and years of loving you Bujjiluuuuuu</p>
